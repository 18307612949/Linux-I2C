   This code was written for my own project by me. I tried this code on BeagleBone Black Ubuntu 12.10. It's work with Arduino UNO R3 and MPU6050 6 axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope. I2C library is experimental so there is no warranty. It's basic and I am working for developing. If there is a some problem or some additional for this library, you can share me.

This library has specific methods for Arduino. You can communicate with Arduino easily.
Some methods have "NoExit" suffix. This means if there is an error accour while reading or writing, the connection doesn't terminated.
