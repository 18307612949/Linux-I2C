   This code was written for my own project by me. I tried this code on BeagleBone Black Ubuntu 12.10. It's work with Arduino UNO R3 and MPU6050 6 axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope. (You can found MPU6050 basic library for BeagleBone Black in my repositories.)  I2C library is experimental so there is no warranty. If there is a some problem or some additional for this library, you can share me.
