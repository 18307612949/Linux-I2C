   This code was written for my own project by me. I tried this code on BeagleBone Black Ubuntu 12.10. It's work with Arduino UNO R3 and MPU6050 6 axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope. You can found MPU6050 basic library for BeagleBone Black. I2C library is experimental so there is no warranty. MPU 6050 library for BeagleBone Black. It's basic and I am working for developing. If there is a some problem or some additional for this library, you can share me.
